				<h3>'Mad Max' an opera of velocity and excess</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;"><em>R</em></span>emakes of classic films are rarely a good idea.</p>
				<p>But when the original filmmaker upgrades and expands on an idea and uses new technology while retaining the essence of the original story, it can be just the ticket for jaded moviegoers.</p>
				<p>Such is the case with Mad Max: Fury Road, an operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem (*** out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).<p>
				<p>It's exhilarating, deranged and exhausting in almost equal measures.</p>
				<p>George Miller is the mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise and his vision has spawned countless post-apocalyptic imitators. He was exactly the right filmmaker to take on a revamped Max. The 1979 original starred Mel Gibson (as did the pair of sequels that followed in the '80s). This latter day Max, played by Tom Hardy, has an intensity amid an overall stoicism that Gibson did not project.</p>
				<p>Hardy is terrific as the titular former lawman/lone wolf character. He's the rare actor who is equally good in serious dramas, low-key character-driven tales and adrenaline-fueled action thrillers. As the haunted Max Rockatansky, beset with vivid memories and hallucinations of his traumatic past, he is spot-on. Here he is captured by raiders known as War Boys, who use Max as a human blood bank. (This is a grisly world where the barely human and near-dead revive themselves with harvested blood and pumped mother's milk.)</p>
				<p>Max escapes and joins forces with a group of women in a huge tanker truck, led by the one-armed driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron). They are fleeing the tyrannized Citadel, overseen by terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who enslaves the populace and controls the water supply. Mostly, the women fleeing the tyrant look unnaturally healthy and gorgeous amid the devastation and freakish near-bestial creatures that fill this universe.</p>
				<p>The movie is essentially one long, relentless chase scene, with a succession of battles fought across scorched and barren wasteland. Cars and trucks of all sizes hold menacing drivers and passengers bent on annihilation. The warlord's platoon features a death-metal electric guitarist providing cacophonous accompaniment to the tumult. But they're not big on conversation. Dialogue is minimal.</p>
				<p>While the extended action sequences are dazzling, the film succeeds mostly due to the powerful performances of Hardy and Theron.</p>
				<p>The best female action hero since Sigourney Weaver in Alien, Theron is riveting as the clever and determined, shaved-headed Furiosa. She lends the role a fascinating blend of toughness, tenderness and gravitas as we learn her tragic back story in the film's final third.</p>
				<p>Miller returns to the franchise — after films such as Babe and Happy Feet —with a vengeance. Sometimes the vehicular crashes and over-the-top pandemonium grow a bit numbing, though Miller finds a way to make even the carnage inventive.</p>
				<p>Amid all the adrenaline is a strong dose of estrogen. The story has a potent element of female empowerment as women of all ages face off against ridiculously dangerous men and transcend any imposed victimization. Miller dials back Max's machismo and places Furiosa front and center as a principled icon in a way that's almost subversive in the world of male-driven action thrillers.</p>
				<p>Not exactly a re-boot, and more like a rollicking re-imagining, this new Mad Max is grim, as expected, but also exhilarating, high-octane mad fun.</p>

				<h3>Inside Out: Pixar’s latest offers a fun-filled inside view of emotions</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;"><em>I</em></span>nside Out earned some deep responses when it premiered at Cannes last month, with more enthusiastic reviewers promising it would outlive cinema itself, suggesting the movie could re-orient how we think about human thought. I thought it was fun, but … let’s just say it’s often true that movies about going inside people’s heads, from The Wizard of Oz to Being John Malkovich, tend to get inside people’s heads.</p>
				<p>Let’s start with a more modest claim: Inside Out is imaginative and ambitious, even if it sometimes feels a bit manically overstuffed. And it’s definitely a big step up from some recent Pixar films, such as Cars 2 and Monsters University.</p>
				<p>“Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head?” asks Joy (Amy Poehler), but it’s a trick question, because she’s about to show you that you have absolutely no idea.</p>
				<p>Shortly after, we’re introduced to Riley, as a newborn baby. Inside her tiny noggin, behind her blinking eyes, there’s a Star Trek-style control centre in a Space Needle-style tower.</p>
				<p>Joy, with yellow glowing skin and blue hair, really likes to operate the controls. Along with her is the blue, bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith), purple Fear (Bill Hader), fat red firecracker Anger (Lewis Black) and snooty green Disgust (Mindy Kaling).</p>
				<p>Our story jumps to a crisis when Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), now a hockey-loving tomboy of 11, is put under stress. Her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco, where her father has a new tech job and mom doesn’t seem to do much except feel sad.</p>
				<p>The external world that Riley lives in is depicted in the photo-realistic style we know from other Pixar movies, but more everyday-shabby: San Francisco looks grey; her new townhouse home is a dump. There’s a dead mouse in her room (cue Disgust) and the local pizza has broccoli on it (cue Disgust once more).</p>
				<p>Up in the control room, memories – shaped like small, coloured bowling balls – are sent by pneumatic tubes into the giant theme park of the brain. Because Riley is out of sorts, Sadness keeps touching things and making them turn blue. Joy, who keeps trying to keep everyone else in line, loses control: She and Sadness are ejected out of Headquarters and into the brain. Fear, Anger and Disgust are left in charge.</p>
				<p>As depicted in Inside Out, the brain is a kind of Dali-esque fantasy park. Much of it consists of a giant maze, with walls made of what appear to be huge gumball machines, filled with coloured spherical memories. Around them, connected by thin bridges, are a series of “islands of personality” built of core memories, with such titles as Friendship, Family, Goofball and Honesty.</p>
				<p>In other words, it’s a bit busier and more entertaining than what typically goes on in my head, though there’s even less evidence of anyone in charge. There are, however, menial workers discarding phone numbers and old piano lessons (like the recent Jurassic World, the movie seems inspired by issues in theme-park maintenance). There’s also a dark abyss full of lost memories underneath and an automatic “train of thought” that runs around it like a monorail at the zoo.</p>
				<p>Among the train stops is a place where dreams are created on a studio lot, which seems a little obvious. A wittier idea is a place called Abstract Thought. It’s a shortcut to Headquarters, but the characters risk being reduced to Picasso drawings and then mathematical shapes before they get there.</p>
				<p>While Joy (dragging Sadness by the heels, which is not a bad depiction of depression) struggles to get back to Headquarters, out in the “real” world of unexpectedly crummy-looking San Francisco, Riley is having a sad, bad time. She’s embarrassed at school, misses her friends and lashes out at her parents. Our heartstrings get tugged (though that would be another movie).</p>
				<p>Inside Riley’s head, happy memories are disappearing, the “islands of personality” are crumbling and an imaginary childhood friend, depicted as a pink cotton candy elephant named Bing Bong (Richard Kind), refuses to be forgotten. In the Subconscious, a malevolent birthday clown stirs.</p>
				<p>Through the film’s busy middle section, with its bright colours and blink-and-they’re-gone visual gags, sometimes it feels a little like having cartoon characters stomping all over your own brain. At least the Emotions are entertaining, and less one-dimensional than you might think. Lewis Black’s Anger takes great joy in blowing his top, while Sadness has a tender warmth for miserable thoughts.</p>
				<p>If the mechanism of Inside Out seems both simplistic and complicated, the message is straightforward: It’s okay to feel sad, mad, scared or disgusted. Sometimes those feelings are even downright enjoyable.</p>

				<h3>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and the Furious Will of Tom Cruise</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;"><em>O</em></span>n one level, Tom Cruise is an odd choice for a star expected to anchor a spy-movie franchise. Espionage, after all, is largely concerned with the dispassionate collection of information, and Cruise is among the least curious of performers. A defining characteristic of his onscreen persona is the reckless certitude that he already has everything figured out. (This is also, as Oprah Winfrey and Matt Lauer would be happy to remind you, a defining characteristic of his offscreen persona.) Cruise’s technique consistently eschews the interrogative in favor of the declarative. Sure, he’ll dutifully track down missing files and identify enemy agents when tasked with such drudgery. But these are at best secondary chores, connective tissue to hold together the motorcycle chases.</p>
				<p>This, of course, is no problem at all for the Mission: Impossible movies in which Cruise stars, which have consistently viewed plot coherence as an unnecessary luxury and have elevated the MacGuffin to something approaching a philosophical ideal. Indeed, Cruise fits perfectly as the star of the franchise for reasons that are right there in the title. You don’t overcome the “impossible” by thinking it over a little more carefully. (That’s how you deal with the “possible.”) You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance. Other performers might cry more persuasively, for instance, than Cruise did at Jason Robard’s bedside in Magnolia; but none will cry harder. Others might juke more gracefully in their underwear than Cruise did in Risky Business; none will juke with greater conviction.</p>
				<p>The actor’s trademark intensity is put to good use in the latest installment of the franchise, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and never more so than in the opening ten minutes, a Bondian prologue in which the 53-year-old actor (not a stunt double, as he is justifiably eager to remind anyone who’ll listen) clings to the side of a cargo plane as it takes off and ascends to 5,000 feet. It’s a bravura sequence. The only downside is that the movie never again quite reaches such heights, so to speak.</p>
				<p>But little matter. In another scene, Cruise penetrates a torus-shaped underwater vault, holding his breath for what seems the length of a Bible. (According to the movie’s stunt director, during one take Cruise didn’t take a breath for six minutes.) There are fisticuffs and gunfights and an assassination attempt that takes place during a production of Puccini’s Turandot. (Echoes of a similar effort at The Mikado back in 1978’s Foul Play.) And there is—of course—a motorcycle chase, which Cruise conducts with characteristic gusto. Asked at one point if he can track down a particular villain, he replies with what could easily be his life credo: “I won’t stop until I do.”</p>
				<p>The plot, insofar as it matters, revolves around a shadowy syndicate of ex-spies bent on global domination. (It is called, conveniently enough, “the Syndicate.”) Early in the movie, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, of the ridiculously named Impossible Mission Force (IMF), is taken captive by the Syndicate, before escaping with the help of a female agent (Rebecca Ferguson) of indeterminate allegiance. Hunt assembles his usual colleagues (played by Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames) to take on the group. But the mission is complicated by a CIA director (Alec Baldwin) who has succeeded in persuading Congress to shut down the IMF on the grounds that it is a vestige of a bygone era. (Echoes here of nearly every Bond film since Never Say Never Again. All that’s missing is the word “dinosaur.”) The 007 vibe is further heightened by a final act featuring the British Prime Minister (Tom Hollander), the head of MI6 (Simon McBurney), and a rendezvous at the Tower of London.</p>
				<p>For the most part, the supporting cast does what it’s paid to do: support. Ferguson holds her own in the physical charisma department, and Sean Harris makes the most of his role as the head of the Syndicate, all soft murmurs and stylish eyewear. Alas, Baldwin gives the strong impression that he has, Nicholson-like, become too large a character in his own right to convincingly play anyone else, at least in non-comic roles. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (teaming with Cruise again following 2012’s Jack Reacher) keeps things moving along briskly and with appropriate levity, though the movie overstays its welcome slightly at a bit over two hours.</p>
				<p>But it’s Cruise who serves—almost literally—as the engine driving the movie. His performance is difficult to rate in the customary sense, because he has entered a phase in his career when “acting” seems almost tangential to his job description. There was a time when Cruise was eager to test his mettle with such fare as Born on the Fourth of July and Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. But the challenges he’s set for himself lately seem principally physical in nature, as if by hanging off planes and diving underwater he can stop his own clock from ticking into middle age. It’s an exercise simultaneously triumphant and dispiriting, and there is an odd fascination in watching how much longer he can pull it off. Another Jack Reacher movie is planned, along with at least one more installment of Mission: Impossible, and Cruise has expressed interest in making sequels to Edge of Tomorrow and even Top Gun. Love him or hate him, Tom Cruise still has no intention of stopping.</p>

				<h3>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is full of thrills but quickly forgettable</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold"><em>I</em></span>t would be silly to pretend that "Avengers: Age of Ultron" isn't good at what it does, that it's not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most.</p>
				<p>With a budget of $250 million, a surfeit of stunts, explosions and computer effects, not to mention a checklist of Marvel Comics champions that includes Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye, this "Avengers" definitely does not go the minimalist route. (It even throws in a couple of characters named Maximoff for good measure.)</p>
				<p>As written and directed by the skilled Joss Whedon, this Avengers movie even has, in its namesake Ultron, a convincingly twisted villain played by James Spader. Sounding uncomfortably presidential in his search for "the power to make real change," Ultron wants to destroy the world and kill everyone in it for the best possible reasons.</p>
				<p>But even as all these good things are acknowledged, the uncomfortable reality remains that although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed.</p>
				<p>Given that the Marvel movies are, in effect, expensive Saturday matinee serials, bringing back the same familiar characters time after time after time (this is, for instance, the fifth film in which Robert Downey Jr. has starred as Iron Man), that lack of staying power is perhaps inevitable. It's the brand, finally, not the individual episodes, that matter most to the powers that be.<p>
				<p>Whedon, whose first Avengers movie was more appealing in part because his sensibility was fresher, works very hard to compensate for this over-familiarity in big ways and small. Even the Avengers' weaponry, the press material informs us, has been "tweaked," with Captain America (Chris Evans) getting a shield with a boomerang effect and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) acquiring an automated quiver ideal for the swiftest possible loading of arrows.</p>
				<p>Whedon's dialogue writing is also a plus, and not just for the clever lines he comes up with. There may be no one else who would or could fit amusing references to Banksy, Eugene O'Neill and how hard it is to afford a place in Brooklyn into a superhero epic.</p>
				<p>The filmmaker also tries to make up for character familiarity by taking advantage of Marvel's penchant for superheroes with complex psyches and, for instance, amping up the potential for romance between the troubled Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).</p>
				<p>And, knowing that Marvel audiences hunger for fresh blood just as much as the vampires in "Twilight," he has given space to those Maximoffs, the twins employed by the evil empire Hydra to battle the Avengers and usually known by their superpower names. Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is the superfast Quicksilver and sister Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) is Scarlet Witch, characterized by the ability to cloud men's minds.</p>
				<p>Where this Avengers movie is at its weakest is in its plot. Well-made though each action sequence may be, there are so many of them, including more going on in the pre-credits sequence than in many entire films, that everything blurs together. One may remember that the Hulk went on a rampage in Johannesburg, South Africa, of all places, but there have been so many rampages in so many movies that reasons and motivations get lost in a frenetic, undifferentiated heap.</p>
				<p>Whether this is what fans ravenous for nonstop stimulation want, what Wheedon prefers or what the Marvel hierarchy mandates, all this action overloads the senses. When you add in a bloated running time of two hours, 22 minutes, what happens on the screen stays on the screen and is difficult to recall later on.</p>
				<p>That's a shame, because it detracts from Ultron, one of the most memorable of Marvel movie villains and an entity impossible to confuse with anything else.</p>
				<p>Before we meet Ultron, the Avengers raid a Hydra redoubt in the conveniently fictional country of Sokovia. There they recover Loki's powerful scepter, which had somehow fallen into the hands of the evildoers.</p>
				<p>Back in the U.S. of A., where the Avengers have their own skyscraper, complete with an enormous logo, Tony Stark (Downey) gets the unfortunate idea to clandestinely use the scepter to create Ultron, a creature of artificial intelligence he intends to function as a global peace-keeping apparatus.</p>
				<p>But, wouldn't you know it, wires get crossed and Ultron gets everything mixed up. "I know you mean well, but you haven't thought it through," he tells the overmatched and befuddled Avengers. "There is only one path to peace: your extinction."</p>
				<p>Beautifully voiced and brought to life by Spader in a motion capture suit, Ultron is eccentric enough to do things like singing "there are no strings on me" when he initially breaks free of Stark's control. Ultron is certainly a memorable creation, which is not always what you can say about the film that brought him to life.</p>
